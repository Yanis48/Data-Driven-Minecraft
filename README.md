# MinecraftData [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FVbico/MinecraftData.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FVbico/MinecraftData)

This project's goal is to improve the structure and readability of Minecraft's JSON files in order to maximize the modifiability through resource/data packs and hopefully fix some long-lasting bugs (such as [MC-957](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-957), for example). The main purpose of these files is for Mojang to implement them at some point.

Feel free to create an issue and/or a pull request if you have any ideas on how these files could be improved.
Go ahead and share this repository! The more constructive voices we have, the better the files will get.
